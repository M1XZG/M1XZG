### Hey, thanks for sliding into my profile ðŸ‘‹

I love to drink coffee, too much coffee.

I'm currently working at [GitHub](@github) and LOVE it! Mostly I like to tinker with bash/zsh scripts and home automation. I love [Raspberry Pi's](@raspberrypi) and use quite a few of them in use for various jobs around the house. Most recently I'm using a Pi 4 8GB with [Docker](@docker) to run a couple of custom containers which I might release as well as [Plex](@plex).

Some of my fav projects and organisation on GitHub that I'm part of, support or just use are:

[Swindon Makerspace](https://github.com/swindonmakers)
[OhMyZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
[ZSH History](https://github.com/rchakra3/zsh_history)

... more to come, I just can't think of them off hand

Thanks for stopping by, you can find me on various [social media platforms](https://www.uk-experience.com/social-media-site-links/)
(that's also a link to my blog, I really need to get more active on there)
