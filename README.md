## Hey, thanks for sliding into my profile ðŸ‘‹

I love to drink coffee :coffee:, too much coffee :coffee: :coffee: :coffee:.

I'm currently working at [GitHub](/github) :octocat: and :heartpulse: it! 

Mostly I like to tinker with bash/zsh scripts and home automation. I love [Raspberry Pi's](/raspberrypi) and use quite a few of them in use for various jobs around the house. Most recently I'm using a Pi 4 8GB with [Docker](/docker) to run a couple of custom containers which I might release as well as [Plex](/plex).

Some of my fav projects and organisation on GitHub that I'm part of, support or just use are:

- [Swindon Makerspace](https://github.com/swindonmakers)
- [OhMyZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [ZSH History](https://github.com/rchakra3/zsh_history)
- ... more to come, I just can't think of them off hand

Thanks for stopping by, you can find me on various [social media platforms](https://www.uk-experience.com/social-media-site-links/)
(that's also a link to my blog, I really need to get more active on there)

Psst if you don't know what icons are available, check out this [emoji cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
